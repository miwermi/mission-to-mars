## Project Overview

Junior data Scientist Robin does free lance astronomy work and hopes to work for NASA someday.  She spends a lot of time reading web articles and is currently fascinated with Mars.  For this project, I've helped Robin code a web scraper that puts together Mars data from several different sites:  

- MARS Planet Science (https://redplanetscience.com)
- California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Lab (https://spaceimages-mars.com)
- Galaxy Facts on Mars (https://galaxyfacts-mars.com)
- Astropedia's Lunar and Planetary Cartographic Catalog (https://marshemispheres.com)

To show Robin my work, I've created an HTML index that populates with Flask from Python code and a Mongo database.  Each time my python code is run, each of the sites we're pulling from is visited and new info is stored in the MongoDB and then called back to the page.
